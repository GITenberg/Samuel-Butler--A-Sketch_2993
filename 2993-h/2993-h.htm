<h2>Samuel Butler: A Sketch</h2>
<p>Samuel Butler was born on the 4th December, 1835, at the 
Rectory, Langar, near Bingham, in Nottinghamshire.&nbsp; His 
father was the Rev. Thomas Butler, then Rector of Langar, 
afterwards one of the canons of Lincoln Cathedral, and his mother
was Fanny Worsley, daughter of John Philip Worsley of 
Arno&rsquo;s Vale, Bristol, sugar-refiner.&nbsp; His grandfather 
was Dr. Samuel Butler, the famous headmaster of Shrewsbury 
School, afterwards Bishop of Lichfield.&nbsp; The Butlers are not
related either to the author of <i>Hudibras</i>, or to the author
of the <i>Analogy</i>, or to the present Master of Trinity 
College, Cambridge.</p>
<p>Butler&rsquo;s father, after being at school at Shrewsbury 
under Dr. Butler, went up to St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge;
he took his degree in 1829, being seventh classic and twentieth 
senior optime; he was ordained and returned to Shrewsbury, where 
he was for some time assistant master at the school under Dr. 
Butler.&nbsp; He married in 1832 and left Shrewsbury for 
Langar.&nbsp; He was a learned botanist, and made a collection of
dried plants which he gave to the Town Museum of Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>Butler&rsquo;s childhood and early life were spent at Langar 
among the surroundings of an English country rectory, and his 
education was begun by his father.&nbsp; In 1843, when he was 
only eight years old, the first great event in his life occurred;
the family, consisting of his father and mother, his two sisters,
his brother and himself, went to Italy.&nbsp; The South-Eastern 
Railway stopped at Ashford, whence they travelled to Dover in 
their own carriage; the carnage was put on board the steamboat, 
they crossed the Channel, and proceeded to Cologne, up the Rhine 
to Basle and on through Switzerland into Italy, through Parma, 
where Napoleon&rsquo;s widow was still reigning, Modena, Bologna,
Florence, and so to Rome.&nbsp; They had to drive where there was
no railway, and there was then none in all Italy except between 
Naples and Castellamare.&nbsp; They seemed to pass a fresh 
custom-house every day, but, by tipping the searchers, generally 
got through without inconvenience.&nbsp; The bread was sour and 
the Italian butter rank and cheesy&mdash;often uneatable.&nbsp; 
Beggars ran after the carriage all day long, and when they got 
nothing jeered at the travellers and called them heretics.&nbsp; 
They spent half the winter in Rome, and the children were taken 
up to the top of St. Peter&rsquo;s as a treat to celebrate their 
father&rsquo;s birthday.&nbsp; In the Sistine Chapel they saw the
cardinals kiss the toe of Pope Gregory XVI., and in the Corso, in
broad daylight, they saw a monk come rolling down a staircase 
like a sack of potatoes, bundled into the street by a man and his
wife.&nbsp; The second half of the winter was spent in 
Naples.&nbsp; This early introduction to the land which he always
thought of and often referred to as his second country made an 
ineffaceable impression upon him.</p>
<p>In January, 1846, he went to school at Allesley, near 
Coventry, under the Rev. E. Gibson.&nbsp; He seldom referred to 
his life there, though sometimes he would say something that 
showed he had not forgotten all about it.&nbsp; For instance, in 
1900, Mr. Sydney C. Cockerell, now the Director of the 
Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, showed him a medieval missal, 
laboriously illuminated.&nbsp; He found that it fatigued him to 
look at it, and said that such books ought never to be 
made.&nbsp; Cockerell replied that such books relieved the tedium
of divine service, on which Butler made a note ending thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>Give me rather a robin or a peripatetic cat like 
the one whose loss the parishioners of St. Clement Danes are 
still deploring.&nbsp; When I was at school at Allesley the boy 
who knelt opposite me at morning prayers, with his face not more 
than a yard away from mine, used to blow pretty little bubbles 
with his saliva which he would send sailing off the tip of his 
tongue like miniature soap bubbles; they very soon broke, but 
they had a career of a foot or two.&nbsp; I never saw anyone else
able to get saliva bubbles right away from him and, though I have
endeavoured for some fifty years and more to acquire the art, I 
never yet could start the bubble off my tongue without its 
bursting.&nbsp; Now things like this really do relieve the tedium
of church, but no missal that I have ever seen will do anything 
except increase it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1848 he left Allesley and went to Shrewsbury under the Rev.
B. H. Kennedy.&nbsp; Many of the recollections of his school life
at Shrewsbury are reproduced for the school life of Ernest 
Pontifex at Roughborough in <i>The Way of All Flesh</i>, Dr. 
Skinner being Dr. Kennedy.</p>
<p>During these years he first heard the music of Handel; it went
straight to his heart and satisfied a longing which the music of 
other composers had only awakened and intensified.&nbsp; He 
became as one of the listening brethren who stood around 
&ldquo;when Jubal struck the chorded shell&rdquo; in the <i>Song 
for Saint Cecilia&rsquo;s Day</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Less than a god, they thought, there could not 
dwell<br />
Within the hollow of that shell<br />
That spoke so sweetly and so well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the second great event in his life, and henceforward 
Italy and Handel were always present at the bottom of his mind as
a kind of double pedal to every thought, word, and deed.&nbsp; 
Almost the last thing he ever asked me to do for him, within a 
few days of his death, was to bring <i>Solomon</i> that he might 
refresh his memory as to the harmonies of &ldquo;With thee 
th&rsquo; unsheltered moor I&rsquo;d trace.&rdquo;&nbsp; He often
tried to like the music of Bach and Beethoven, but found himself 
compelled to give them up&mdash;they bored him too much.&nbsp; 
Nor was he more successful with the other great composers; Haydn,
for instance, was a sort of Horace, an agreeable, facile man of 
the world, while Mozart, who must have loved Handel, for he wrote
additional accompaniments to the <i>Messiah</i>, failed to move 
him.&nbsp; It was not that he disputed the greatness of these 
composers, but he was out of sympathy with them, and never could 
forgive the last two for having led music astray from the Handel 
tradition, and paved the road from Bach to Beethoven.&nbsp; 
Everything connected with Handel interested him.&nbsp; He 
remembered old Mr. Brooke, Rector of Gamston, North Notts, who 
had been present at the Handel Commemoration in 1784, and his 
great-aunt, Miss Susannah Apthorp, of Cambridge, had known a lady
who had sat upon Handel&rsquo;s knee.&nbsp; He often regretted 
that these were his only links with &ldquo;the greatest of all 
composers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides his love for Handel he had a strong liking for 
drawing, and, during the winter of 1853-4, his family again took 
him to Italy, where, being now eighteen, he looked on the works 
of the old masters with intelligence.</p>
<p>In October, 1854, he went into residence at St. John&rsquo;s 
College, Cambridge.&nbsp; He showed no aptitude for any 
particular branch of academic study, nevertheless he impressed 
his friends as being likely to make his mark.&nbsp; Just as he 
used reminiscences of his own schooldays at Shrewsbury for 
Ernest&rsquo;s life at Roughborough, so he used reminiscences of 
his own Cambridge days for those of Ernest.&nbsp; When the 
Simeonites, in <i>The Way of All Flesh</i>, &ldquo;distributed 
tracts, dropping them at night in good men&rsquo;s letter boxes 
while they slept, their tracts got burnt or met with even worse 
contumely.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ernest Pontifex went so far as to parody 
one of these tracts and to get a copy of the parody 
&ldquo;dropped into each of the Simeonites&rsquo; boxes.&rdquo; 
Ernest did this in the novel because Butler had done it in real 
life.&nbsp; Mr. A. T. Bartholomew, of the University Library, has
found, among the Cambridge papers of the late J. Willis 
Clark&rsquo;s collection, three printed pieces belonging to the 
year 1855 bearing on the subject.&nbsp; He speaks of them in an 
article headed &ldquo;Samuel Butler and the Simeonites,&rdquo; 
and signed A. T. B. in the <i>Cambridge Magazine</i>, 1st March, 
1913; the first is &ldquo;a genuine Simeonite tract; the other 
two are parodies.&nbsp; All three are anonymous.&nbsp; At the top
of the second parody is written &lsquo;By S. Butler, March 
31.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The article gives extracts from the 
genuine tract and the whole of Butler&rsquo;s parody.</p>
<p>Besides parodying Simeonite tracts, Butler wrote various other
papers during his undergraduate days, some of which, preserved by
one of his contemporaries, who remained a lifelong friend, the 
Rev. Canon Joseph M&rsquo;Cormick, now Rector of St. 
James&rsquo;s, Piccadilly, are reproduced in <i>The Note-Books of
Samuel Butler</i> (1912).</p>
<p>He also steered the Lady Margaret first boat, and Canon 
M&rsquo;Cormick told me of a mishap that occurred on the last 
night of the races in 1857.&nbsp; Lady Margaret had been head of 
the river since 1854, Canon M&rsquo;Cormick was rowing 5, Philip 
Pennant Pearson (afterwards P. Pennant) was 7, Canon Kynaston, of
Durham (whose name formerly was Snow), was stroke, and Butler was
cox.&nbsp; When the cox let go of the bung at starting, the rope 
caught in his rudder lines, and Lady Margaret was nearly bumped 
by Second Trinity.&nbsp; They escaped, however, and their 
pursuers were so much exhausted by their efforts to catch them 
that they were themselves bumped by First Trinity at the next 
corner.&nbsp; Butler wrote home about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>11 March, 1857.&nbsp; Dear Mamma: My foreboding 
about steering was on the last day nearly verified by an accident
which was more deplorable than culpable the effects of which 
would have been ruinous had not the presence of mind of No. 7 in 
the boat rescued us from the very jaws of defeat.&nbsp; The scene
is one which never can fade from my remembrance and will be 
connected always with the gentlemanly conduct of the crew in 
neither using opprobrious language nor gesture towards your 
unfortunate son but treating him with the most graceful 
forbearance; for in most cases when an accident happens which in 
itself is but slight, but is visited with serious consequences, 
most people get carried away with the impression created by the 
last so as to entirely forget the accidental nature of the cause 
and if we had been quite bumped I should have been ruined, as it 
is I get praise for coolness and good steering as much as and 
more than blame for my accident and the crew are so delighted at 
having rowed a race such as never was seen before that they are 
satisfied completely.&nbsp; All the spectators saw the race and 
were delighted; another inch and I should never have held up my 
head again.&nbsp; One thing is safe, it will never happen 
again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Eagle</i>, &ldquo;a magazine supported by members of 
St. John&rsquo;s College,&rdquo; issued its first number in the 
Lent term of 1858; it contains an article by Butler &ldquo;On 
English Composition and Other Matters,&rdquo; signed 
&ldquo;Cellarius&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most readers will have anticipated me in admitting
that a man should be clear of his meaning before he endeavours to
give it any kind of utterance, and that, having made up his mind 
what to say, the less thought he takes how to say it, more than 
briefly, pointedly and plainly, the better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this it appears that, when only just over twenty-two, 
Butler had already discovered and adopted those principles of 
writing from which he never departed.</p>
<p>In the fifth number of the <i>Eagle</i> is an article, 
&ldquo;Our Tour,&rdquo; also signed &ldquo;Cellarius&rdquo;; it 
is an account of a tour made in June, 1857, with a friend whose 
name he Italianized into Giuseppe Verdi, through France into 
North Italy, and was written, so he says, to show how they got so
much into three weeks and spent only &pound;25; they did not, 
however, spend quite so much, for the article goes on, after 
bringing them back to England, &ldquo;Next day came safely home 
to dear old St. John&rsquo;s, cash in hand 7d.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1" 
class="citation">[1]</a></p>
<p>Butler worked hard with Shilleto, an old pupil of his 
grandfather, and was bracketed 12th in the Classical Tripos of 
1858.&nbsp; Canon M&rsquo;Cormick told me that he would no doubt 
have been higher but for the fact that he at first intended to go
out in mathematics; it was only during the last year of his time 
that he returned to the classics, and his being so high as he was
spoke well for the classical education of Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>It had always been an understood thing that he was to follow 
in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and become a 
clergyman; accordingly, after taking his degree, he went to 
London and began to prepare for ordination, living and working 
among the poor as lay assistant under the Rev. Philip Perring, 
Curate of St. James&rsquo;s, Piccadilly, an old pupil of Dr. 
Butler at Shrewsbury. <a name="citation2"></a><a 
href="#footnote2" class="citation">[2]</a>&nbsp; Placed among 
such surroundings, he felt bound to think out for himself many 
theological questions which at this time were first presented to 
him, and, the conclusion being forced upon him that he could not 
believe in the efficacy of infant baptism, he declined to be 
ordained.</p>
<p>It was now his desire to become an artist; this, however, did 
not meet with the approval of his family, and he returned to 
Cambridge to try for pupils and, if possible, to get a 
fellowship.&nbsp; He liked being at Cambridge, but there were few
pupils and, as there seemed to be little chance of a fellowship, 
his father wished him to come down and adopt some 
profession.&nbsp; A long correspondence took place in the course 
of which many alternatives were considered.&nbsp; There are 
letters about his becoming a farmer in England, a tutor, a 
homoepathic doctor, an artist, or a publisher, and the 
possibilities of the army, the bar, and diplomacy.&nbsp; Finally 
it was decided that he should emigrate to New Zealand.&nbsp; His 
passage was paid, and he was to sail in the <i>Burmah</i>, but a 
cousin of his received information about this vessel which caused
him, much against his will, to get back his passage money and 
take a berth in the <i>Roman Emperor</i>, which sailed from 
Gravesend on one of the last days of September, 1859.&nbsp; On 
that night, for the first time in his life, he did not say his 
prayers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose the sense of change was so great 
that it shook them quietly off.&nbsp; I was not then a sceptic; I
had got as far as disbelief in infant baptism, but no 
further.&nbsp; I felt no compunction of conscience, however, 
about leaving off my morning and evening prayers&mdash;simply I 
could no longer say them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Roman Emperor</i>, after a voyage every incident of 
which interested him deeply, arrived outside Port 
Lyttelton.&nbsp; The captain shouted to the pilot who came to 
take them in:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the <i>Robert Small</i> arrived?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the pilot, &ldquo;nor yet the 
<i>Burmah</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Butler, writing home to his people, adds the comment: 
&ldquo;You may imagine what I felt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Burmah</i> was never heard of again.</p>
<p>He spent some time looking round, considering what to do and 
how to employ the money with which his father was ready to supply
him, and determined upon sheep-farming.&nbsp; He made several 
excursions looking for country, and ultimately took up a run 
which is still called Mesopotamia, the name he gave it because it
is situated among the head-waters of the Rangitata.</p>
<p>It was necessary to have a horse, and he bought one for 
&pound;55, which was not considered dear.&nbsp; He wrote home 
that the horse&rsquo;s name was &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo;: &ldquo;I 
hope he is a Homoeopathist.&rdquo;&nbsp; From this, and from the 
fact that he had already contemplated becoming a homoeopathic 
doctor himself, I conclude that he had made the acquaintance of 
Dr. Robert Ellis Dudgeon, the eminent homoeopathist, while he was
doing parish work in London.&nbsp; After his return to England 
Dr. Dudgeon was his medical adviser, and remained one of his most
intimate friends until the end of his life.&nbsp; Doctor, the 
horse, is introduced into <i>Erewhon Revisited</i>; the shepherd 
in Chapter XXVI tells John Hicks that Doctor &ldquo;would pick 
fords better than that gentleman could, I know, and if the 
gentleman fell off him he would just stay stock still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Butler carried on his run for about four and a half years, and
the open-air life agreed with him; he ascribed to this the good 
health he afterwards enjoyed.&nbsp; The following, taken from a 
notebook he kept in the colony and destroyed, gives a glimpse of 
one side of his life there; he preserved the note because it 
recalled New Zealand so vividly.</p>
<blockquote><p>April, 1861.&nbsp; It is Sunday.&nbsp; We rose 
later than usual.&nbsp; There are five of us sleeping in the 
hut.&nbsp; I sleep in a bunk on one side of the fire; Mr. Haast, 
<a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3" 
class="citation">[3]</a> a German who is making a geological 
survey of the province, sleeps upon the opposite one; my 
bullock-driver and hut-keeper have two bunks at the far end of 
the hut, along the wall, while my shepherd lies in the loft among
the tea and sugar and flour.&nbsp; It was a fine morning, and we 
turned out about seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>The usual mutton and bread for breakfast with a pudding made 
of flour and water baked in the camp oven after a joint of 
meat&mdash;Yorkshire pudding, but without eggs.&nbsp; While we 
were at breakfast a robin perched on the table and sat there a 
good while pecking at the sugar.&nbsp; We went on breakfasting 
with little heed to the robin, and the robin went on pecking with
little heed to us.&nbsp; After breakfast Pey, my bullock-driver, 
went to fetch the horses up from a spot about two miles down the 
river, where they often run; we wanted to go pig-hunting.</p>
<p>I go into the garden and gather a few peascods for seed till 
the horses should come up.&nbsp; Then Cook, the shepherd, says 
that a fire has sprung up on the other side of the river.&nbsp; 
Who could have lit it?&nbsp; Probably someone who had intended 
coming to my place on the preceding evening and has missed his 
way, for there is no track of any sort between here and 
Phillips&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In a quarter of an hour he lit another 
fire lower down, and by that time, the horses having come up, 
Haast and myself&mdash;remembering how Dr. Sinclair had just been
drowned so near the same spot&mdash;think it safer to ride over 
to him and put him across the river.&nbsp; The river was very low
and so clear that we could see every stone.&nbsp; On getting to 
the river-bed we lit a fire and did the same on leaving it; our 
tracks would guide anyone over the intervening ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides his occupation with the sheep, he found time to play 
the piano, to read and to write.&nbsp; In the library of St. 
John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, are two copies of the Greek 
Testament, very fully annotated by him at the University and in 
the colony.&nbsp; He also read the <i>Origin of Species</i>, 
which, as everyone knows, was published in 1859.&nbsp; He became 
&ldquo;one of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s many enthusiastic admirers, and 
wrote a philosophic dialogue (the most offensive form, except 
poetry and books of travel into supposed unknown countries, that 
even literature can assume) upon the <i>Origin of 
Species</i>&rdquo; (<i>Unconscious Memory</i>, close of Chapter 
I).&nbsp; This dialogue, unsigned, was printed in the 
<i>Press</i>, Canterbury, New Zealand, on 20th December, 
1862.&nbsp; A copy of the paper was sent to Charles Darwin, who 
forwarded it to a, presumably, English editor with a letter, now 
in the Canterbury Museum, New Zealand, speaking of the dialogue 
as &ldquo;remarkable from its spirit and from giving so clear and
accurate an account of Mr. D&rsquo;s theory.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is 
possible that Butler himself sent the newspaper containing his 
dialogue to Mr. Darwin; if so he did not disclose his name, for 
Darwin says in his letter that he does not know who the author 
was.&nbsp; Butler was closely connected with the <i>Press</i>, 
which was founded by James Edward FitzGerald, the first 
Superintendent of the Province, in May, 1861; he frequently 
contributed to its pages, and once, during FitzGerald&rsquo;s 
absence, had charge of it for a short time, though he was never 
its actual editor.&nbsp; The <i>Press</i> reprinted the dialogue 
and the correspondence which followed its original appearance on 
8th June, 1912.</p>
<p>On 13th June, 1863, the <i>Press</i> printed a letter by 
Butler signed &ldquo;Cellarius&rdquo; and headed &ldquo;Darwin 
among the Machines,&rdquo; reprinted in <i>The Note-Books of 
Samuel Butler</i> (1912).&nbsp; The letter begins:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir: There are few things of which the present 
generation is more justly proud than of the wonderful 
improvements which are daily taking place in all sorts of 
mechanical appliances&rdquo;; and goes on to say that, as the 
vegetable kingdom was developed from the mineral, and as the 
animal kingdom supervened upon the vegetable, &ldquo;so now, in 
the last few ages, an entirely new kingdom has sprung up of which
we as yet have only seen what will one day be considered the 
antediluvian types of the race.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then speaks of 
the minute members which compose the beautiful and intelligent 
little animal which we call the watch, and of how it has 
gradually been evolved from the clumsy brass clocks of the 
thirteenth century.&nbsp; Then comes the question: Who will be 
man&rsquo;s successor?&nbsp; To which the answer is: We are 
ourselves creating our own successors.&nbsp; Man will become to 
the machine what the horse and the dog are to man; the conclusion
being that machines are, or are becoming, animate.</p>
<p>In 1863 Butler&rsquo;s family published in his name <i>A First
Year in Canterbury Settlement</i>, which, as the preface states, 
was compiled from his letters home, his journal and extracts from
two papers contributed to the <i>Eagle</i>.&nbsp; These two 
papers had appeared in the <i>Eagle</i> as three articles 
entitled &ldquo;Our Emigrant&rdquo; and signed 
&ldquo;Cellarius.&rdquo;&nbsp; The proof-sheets of the book went 
out to New Zealand for correction and were sent back in the 
Colombo, which was as unfortunate as the <i>Burmah</i>, for she 
was wrecked.&nbsp; The proofs, however, were fished up, though so
nearly washed out as to be almost undecipherable.&nbsp; Butler 
would have been just as well pleased if they had remained at the 
bottom of the Indian Ocean, for he never liked the book and 
always spoke of it as being full of youthful priggishness; but I 
think he was a little hard upon it.&nbsp; Years afterwards, in 
one of his later books, after quoting two passages from Mr. Grant
Allen and pointing out why he considered the second to be a 
recantation of the first, he wrote: &ldquo;When Mr. Allen does 
make stepping-stones of his dead selves he jumps upon them to 
some tune.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he was perhaps a little inclined to 
treat his own dead self too much in the same spirit.</p>
<p>Butler did very well with the sheep, sold out in 1864, and 
returned via Callao to England.&nbsp; He travelled with three 
friends whose acquaintance he had made in the colony; one was 
Charles Paine Pauli, to whom he dedicated <i>Life and 
Habit</i>.&nbsp; He arrived in August, 1864, in London, where he 
took chambers consisting of a sitting-room, a bedroom, a 
painting-room and a pantry, at 15, Clifford&rsquo;s Inn, second 
floor (north).&nbsp; The net financial result of the 
sheep-farming and the selling out was that he practically doubled
his capital, that is to say he had about &pound;8,000.&nbsp; This
he left in New Zealand, invested on mortgage at 10 per cent., the
then current rate in the colony; it produced more than enough for
him to live upon in the very simple way that suited him best, and
life in the Inns of Court resembles life at Cambridge in that it 
reduces the cares of housekeeping to a minimum; it suited him so 
well that he never changed his rooms, remaining there 
thirty-eight years till his death.</p>
<p>He was now his own master and able at last to turn to 
painting.&nbsp; He studied at the art school in Streatham Street,
Bloomsbury, which had formerly been managed by Henry Sass, but, 
in Butler&rsquo;s time, was being carried on by Francis Stephen 
Cary, son of the Rev. Henry Francis Cary, who had been a 
school-fellow of Dr. Butler at Rugby, and is well known as the 
translator of Dante and the friend of Charles Lamb.&nbsp; Among 
his fellow-students was Mr. H. R. Robertson, who told me that the
young artists got hold of the legend, which is in some of the 
books about Lamb, that when Francis Stephen Cary was a boy and 
there was a talk at his father&rsquo;s house as to what 
profession he should take up, Lamb, who was present, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should make him an apo-po-pothe-Cary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They used to repeat this story freely among themselves, being,
no doubt, amused by the Lamb-like pun, but also enjoying the 
malicious pleasure of hinting that it might have been as well for
their art education if the advice of the gentle humorist had been
followed.&nbsp; Anyone who wants to know what kind of an artist 
F. S. Cary was can see his picture of Charles and Mary Lamb in 
the National Portrait Gallery.</p>
<p>In 1865 Butler sent from London to New Zealand an article 
entitled &ldquo;Lucubratio Ebria,&rdquo; which was published in 
the <i>Press</i> of 29th July, 1865.&nbsp; It treated machines 
from a point of view different from that adopted in &ldquo;Darwin
among the Machines,&rdquo; and was one of the steps that led to 
<i>Erewhon</i> and ultimately to <i>Life and Habit</i>.&nbsp; The
article is reproduced in <i>The Note-Books of Samuel Butler</i> 
(1912).</p>
<p>Butler also studied art at South Kensington, but by 1867 he 
had begun to go to Heatherley&rsquo;s School of Art in Newman 
Street, where he continued going for many years.&nbsp; He made a 
number of friends at Heatherley&rsquo;s, and among them Miss 
Eliza Mary Anne Savage.&nbsp; There also he first met Charles 
Gogin, who, in 1896, painted the portrait of Butler which is now 
in the National Portrait Gallery.&nbsp; He described himself as 
an artist in the Post Office Directory, and between 1868 and 1876
exhibited at the Royal Academy about a dozen pictures, of which 
the most important was &ldquo;Mr. Heatherley&rsquo;s 
Holiday,&rdquo; hung on the line in 1874.&nbsp; He left it by his
will to his college friend Jason Smith, whose representatives, 
after his death, in 1910, gave it to the nation, and it is now in
the National Gallery of British Art.&nbsp; Mr. Heatherley never 
went away for a holiday; he once had to go out of town on 
business and did not return till the next day; one of the 
students asked him how he had got on, saying no doubt he had 
enjoyed the change and that he must have found it refreshing to 
sleep for once out of London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Heatherley, &ldquo;I did not like 
it.&nbsp; Country air has no body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The consequence was that, whenever there was a holiday and the
school was shut, Heatherley employed the time in mending the 
skeleton; Butler&rsquo;s picture represents him so engaged in a 
corner of the studio.&nbsp; In this way he got his model for 
nothing.&nbsp; Sometimes he hung up a looking-glass near one of 
his windows and painted his own portrait.&nbsp; Many of these he 
painted out, but after his death we found a little store of them 
in his rooms, some of the early ones very curious.&nbsp; Of the 
best of them one is now at Canterbury, New Zealand, one at St. 
John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, and one at the Schools, 
Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>This is Butler&rsquo;s own account of himself, taken from a 
letter to Sir Julius von Haast; although written in 1865 it is 
true of his mode of life for many years:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been taking lessons in painting ever since 
I arrived.&nbsp; I was always very fond of it and mean to stick 
to it; it suits me and I am not without hopes that I shall do 
well at it.&nbsp; I live almost the life of a recluse, seeing 
very few people and going nowhere that I can help&mdash;I mean in
the way of parties and so forth; if my friends had their way they
would fritter away my time without any remorse; but I made a 
regular stand against it from the beginning and so, having my 
time pretty much in my own hands, work hard; I find, as I am sure
you must find, that it is next to impossible to combine what is 
commonly called society and work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the time saved from society was not all devoted to 
painting.&nbsp; He modified his letter to the <i>Press</i> about 
&ldquo;Darwin among the Machines&rdquo; and, so modified, it 
appeared in 1865 as &ldquo;The Mechanical Creation&rdquo; in the 
<i>Reasoner</i>, a paper then published in London by Mr. G. J. 
Holyoake.&nbsp; And his mind returned to the considerations which
had determined him to decline to be ordained.&nbsp; In 1865 he 
printed anonymously a pamphlet which he had begun in New Zealand,
the result of his study of the Greek Testament, entitled <i>The 
Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ as given by the 
Four Evangelists critically examined</i>.&nbsp; After weighing 
this evidence and comparing one account with another, he came to 
the conclusion that Jesus Christ did not die upon the 
cross.&nbsp; It is improbable that a man officially executed 
should escape death, but the alternative, that a man actually 
dead should return to life, seemed to Butler more improbable 
still and unsupported by such evidence as he found in the 
gospels.&nbsp; From this evidence he concluded that Christ 
swooned and recovered consciousness after his body had passed 
into the keeping of Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a.&nbsp; He did not 
suppose fraud on the part of the first preachers of Christianity;
they sincerely believed that Christ died and rose again.&nbsp; 
Joseph and Nicodemus probably knew the truth but kept 
silence.&nbsp; The idea of what might follow from belief in one 
single supposed miracle was never hereafter absent from 
Butler&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>In 1869, having been working too hard, he went abroad for a 
long change.&nbsp; On his way back, at the Albergo La Luna, in 
Venice, he met an elderly Russian lady in whose company he spent 
most of his time there.&nbsp; She was no doubt impressed by his 
versatility and charmed, as everyone always was, by his 
conversation and original views on the many subjects that 
interested him.&nbsp; We may be sure he told her all about 
himself and what he had done and was intending to do.&nbsp; At 
the end of his stay, when he was taking leave of her, she 
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Et maintenant, Monsieur, vous allez 
cr&eacute;er,&rdquo; meaning, as he understood her, that he had 
been looking long enough at the work of others and should now do 
something of his own.</p>
<p>This sank into him and pained him.&nbsp; He was nearly 
thirty-five, and hitherto all had been admiration, vague 
aspiration and despair; he had produced in painting nothing but a
few sketches and studies, and in literature only a few ephemeral 
articles, a collection of youthful letters and a pamphlet on the 
Resurrection; moreover, to none of his work had anyone paid the 
slightest attention.&nbsp; This was a poor return for all the 
money which had been spent upon his education, as Theobald would 
have said in <i>The Way of All Flesh</i>.&nbsp; He returned home 
dejected, but resolved that things should be different in the 
future.&nbsp; While in this frame of mind he received a visit 
from one of his New Zealand friends, the late Sir F. Napier 
Broome, afterwards Governor of Western Australia, who 
incidentally suggested his rewriting his New Zealand 
articles.&nbsp; The idea pleased him; it might not be creating, 
but at least it would be doing something.&nbsp; So he set to work
on Sundays and in the evenings, as relaxation from his profession
of painting, and, taking his New Zealand article, &ldquo;Darwin 
among the Machines,&rdquo; and another, &ldquo;The World of the 
Unborn,&rdquo; as a starting-point and helping himself with a few
sentences from <i>A First Year in Canterbury Settlement</i>, he 
gradually formed <i>Erewhon</i>.&nbsp; He sent the MS. bit by 
bit, as it was written, to Miss Savage for her criticism and 
approval.&nbsp; He had the usual difficulty about finding a 
publisher.&nbsp; Chapman and Hall refused the book on the advice 
of George Meredith, who was then their reader, and in the end he 
published it at his own expense through Messrs. Tr&uuml;bner.</p>
<p>Mr. Sydney C. Cockerell told me that in 1912 Mr. Bertram 
Dobell, second-hand bookseller of Charing Cross Road, offered a 
copy of <i>Erewhon</i> for &pound;1 10s.; it was thus described 
in his catalogue: &ldquo;Unique copy with the following note in 
the author&rsquo;s handwriting on the half-title: &lsquo;To Miss 
E. M. A. Savage this first copy of <i>Erewhon</i> with the 
author&rsquo;s best thanks for many invaluable suggestions and 
corrections.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; When Mr. Cockerell inquired for 
the book it was sold.&nbsp; After Miss Savage&rsquo;s death in 
1885 all Butler&rsquo;s letters to her were returned to him, 
including the letter he wrote when he sent her this copy of 
<i>Erewhon</i>.&nbsp; He gave her the first copy issued of all 
his books that were published in her lifetime, and, no doubt, 
wrote an inscription in each.&nbsp; If the present possessors of 
any of them should happen to read this sketch I hope they will 
communicate with me, as I should like to see these books.&nbsp; I
should also like to see some numbers of the <i>Drawing-Room 
Gazette</i>, which about this time belonged to or was edited by a
Mrs. Briggs.&nbsp; Miss Savage wrote a review of <i>Erewhon</i>, 
which appeared in the number for 8th June, 1872, and Butler 
quoted a sentence from her review among the press notices in the 
second edition.&nbsp; She persuaded him to write for Mrs. Briggs 
notices of concerts at which Handel&rsquo;s music was 
performed.&nbsp; In 1901 he made a note on one of his letters 
that he was thankful there were no copies of the <i>Drawing-Room 
Gazette</i> in the British Museum, meaning that he did not want 
people to read his musical criticisms; nevertheless, I hope some 
day to come across back numbers containing his articles.</p>
<p>The opening of <i>Erewhon</i> is based upon Butler&rsquo;s 
colonial experiences; some of the descriptions remind one of 
passages in <i>A First Year in Canterbury Settlement</i>, where 
he speaks of the excursions he made with Doctor when looking for 
sheep-country.&nbsp; The walk over the range as far as the 
statues is taken from the Upper Rangitata district, with some 
alterations; but the walk down from the statues into Erewhon is 
reminiscent of the Leventina Valley in the Canton Ticino.&nbsp; 
The great chords, which are like the music moaned by the statues 
are from the prelude to the first of Handel&rsquo;s <i>Trois 
Le&ccedil;ons</i>; he used to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One feels them in the diaphragm&mdash;they are, as it 
were, the groaning and labouring of all creation travailing 
together until now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a place in New Zealand named Erewhon, after the book;
it is marked on the large maps, a township about fifty miles west
of Napier in the Hawke Bay Province (North Island).&nbsp; I am 
told that people in New Zealand sometimes call their houses 
Erewhon and occasionally spell the word Erehwon which Butler did 
not intend; he treated wh as a single letter, as one would treat 
th.&nbsp; Among other traces of Erewhon now existing in real life
are Butler&rsquo;s Stones on the Hokitika Pass, so called because
of a legend that they were in his mind when he described the 
statues.</p>
<p>The book was translated into Dutch in 1873 and into German in 
1897.</p>
<p>Butler wrote to Charles Darwin to explain what he meant by the
&ldquo;Book of the Machines&rdquo;: &ldquo;I am sincerely sorry 
that some of the critics should have thought I was laughing at 
your theory, a thing which I never meant to do and should be 
shocked at having done.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon after this Butler was 
invited to Down and paid two visits to Mr. Darwin there; he thus 
became acquainted with all the family and for some years was on 
intimate terms with Mr. (now Sir) Francis Darwin.</p>
<p>It is easy to see by the light of subsequent events that we 
should probably have had something not unlike <i>Erewhon</i> 
sooner or later, even without the Russian lady and Sir F. N. 
Broome, to whose promptings, owing to a certain diffidence which 
never left him, he was perhaps inclined to attribute too much 
importance.&nbsp; But he would not have agreed with this view at 
the time; he looked upon himself as a painter and upon 
<i>Erewhon</i> as an interruption.&nbsp; It had come, like one of
those creatures from the Land of the Unborn, pestering him and 
refusing to leave him at peace until he consented to give it 
bodily shape.&nbsp; It was only a little one, and he saw no 
likelihood of its having any successors.&nbsp; So he satisfied 
its demands and then, supposing that he had written himself out, 
looked forward to a future in which nothing should interfere with
the painting.&nbsp; Nevertheless, when another of the unborn came
teasing him he yielded to its importunities and allowed himself 
to become the author of <i>The Fair Haven</i>, which is his 
pamphlet on the Resurrection, enlarged and preceded by a 
realistic memoir of the pseudonymous author, John Pickard 
Owen.&nbsp; In the library of St. John&rsquo;s College, 
Cambridge, are two copies of the pamphlet with pages cut out; he 
used these pages in forming the MS. of <i>The Fair 
Haven</i>.&nbsp; To have published this book as by the author of 
<i>Erewhon</i> would have been to give away the irony and 
satire.&nbsp; And he had another reason for not disclosing his 
name; he remembered that as soon as curiosity about the 
authorship of <i>Erewhon</i> was satisfied, the weekly sales fell
from fifty down to only two or three.&nbsp; But, as he always 
talked openly of whatever was in his mind, he soon let out the 
secret of the authorship of <i>The Fair Haven</i>, and it became 
advisable to put his name to a second edition.</p>
<p>One result of his submitting the MS. of <i>Erewhon</i> to Miss
Savage was that she thought he ought to write a novel, and urged 
him to do so.&nbsp; I have no doubt that he wrote the memoir of 
John Pickard Owen with the idea of quieting Miss Savage and also 
as an experiment to ascertain whether he was likely to succeed 
with a novel.&nbsp; The result seems to have satisfied him, for, 
not long after <i>The Fair Haven</i>, he began <i>The Way of All 
Flesh</i>, sending the MS. to Miss Savage, as he did everything 
he wrote, for her approval and putting her into the book as 
Ernest&rsquo;s Aunt Alethea.&nbsp; He continued writing it in the
intervals of other work until her death in February, 1885, after 
which he did not touch it.&nbsp; It was published in 1903 by Mr. 
R. A. Streatfeild, his literary executor.</p>
<p>Soon after <i>The Fair Haven</i> Butler began to be aware that
his letter in the <i>Press</i>, &ldquo;Darwin among the 
Machines,&rdquo; was descending with further modifications and 
developing in his mind into a theory about evolution which took 
shape as <i>Life and Habit</i>; but the writing of this very 
remarkable and suggestive book was delayed and the painting 
interrupted by absence from England on business in Canada.&nbsp; 
He had been persuaded by a college friend, a member of one of the
great banking families, to call in his colonial mortgages and to 
put the money into several new companies.&nbsp; He was going to 
make thirty or forty per cent, instead of only ten.&nbsp; One of 
these companies was a Canadian undertaking, of which he became a 
director; it was necessary for someone to go to headquarters and 
investigate its affairs; he went, and was much occupied by the 
business for two or three years.&nbsp; By the beginning of 1876 
he had returned finally to London, but most of his money was lost
and his financial position for the next ten years caused him very
serious anxiety.&nbsp; His personal expenditure was already so 
low that it was hardly possible to reduce it, and he set to work 
at his profession more industriously than ever, hoping to paint 
something that he could sell, his spare time being occupied with 
<i>Life and Habit</i>, which was the subject that really 
interested him more deeply than any other.</p>
<p>Following his letter in the <i>Press</i>, wherein he had seen 
machines as in process of becoming animate, he went on to regard 
them as living organs and limbs which we had made outside 
ourselves.&nbsp; What would follow if we reversed this and 
regarded our limbs and organs as machines which we had 
manufactured as parts of our bodies?&nbsp; In the first place, 
how did we come to make them without knowing anything about 
it?&nbsp; But then, how comes anybody to do anything 
unconsciously?&nbsp; The answer usually would be: By habit.&nbsp;
But can a man be said to do a thing by habit when he has never 
done it before?&nbsp; His ancestors have done it, but not 
he.&nbsp; Can the habit have been acquired by them for his 
benefit?&nbsp; Not unless he and his ancestors are the same 
person.&nbsp; Perhaps, then, they are the same person.</p>
<p>In February, 1876, partly to clear his mind and partly to tell
someone, he wrote down his thoughts in a letter to his namesake, 
Thomas William Gale Butler, a fellow art-student who was then in 
New Zealand; so much of the letter as concerns the growth of his 
theory is given in <i>The Note-Books of Samuel Butler</i> 
(1912).</p>
<p>In September, 1877, when <i>Life and Habit</i> was on the eve 
of publication, Mr. Francis Darwin came to lunch with him in 
Clifford&rsquo;s Inn and, in course of conversation, told him 
that Professor Ray Lankester had written something in 
<i>Nature</i> about a lecture by Dr. Ewald Hering of Prague, 
delivered so long ago as 1870, &ldquo;On Memory as a Universal 
Function of Organized Matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; This rather alarmed 
Butler, but he deferred looking up the reference until after 
December, 1877, when his book was out, and then, to his relief, 
he found that Hering&rsquo;s theory was very similar to his own, 
so that, instead of having something sprung upon him which would 
have caused him to want to alter his book, he was 
supported.&nbsp; He at once wrote to the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, 
calling attention to Hering&rsquo;s lecture, and then pursued his
studies in evolution.</p>
<p><i>Life and Habit</i> was followed in 1879 by <i>Evolution Old
and New</i>, wherein he compared the teleological or purposive 
view of evolution taken by Buffon, Dr. Erasmus Darwin, and 
Lamarck with the view taken by Charles Darwin, and came to the 
conclusion that the old was better.&nbsp; But while agreeing with
the earlier writers in thinking that the variations whose 
accumulation results in species were originally due to 
intelligence, he could not take the view that the intelligence 
resided in an external personal God.&nbsp; He had done with all 
that when he gave up the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the 
dead.&nbsp; He proposed to place the intelligence inside the 
creature (&ldquo;The Deadlock in Darwinism,&rdquo; 
<i>post</i>).</p>
<p>In 1880 he continued the subject by publishing <i>Unconscious 
Memory</i>.&nbsp; Chapter IV of this book is concerned with a 
personal quarrel between himself and Charles Darwin which arose 
out of the publication by Charles Darwin of Dr. Krause&rsquo;s 
<i>Life of Erasmus Darwin</i>.&nbsp; We need not enter into 
particulars here, the matter is fully dealt with in a pamphlet, 
<i>Charles Darwin and Samuel Butler</i>: <i>A Step towards 
Reconciliation</i>, which I wrote in 1911, the result of a 
correspondence between Mr. Francis Darwin and myself.&nbsp; 
Before this correspondence took place Mr. Francis Darwin had made
several public allusions to <i>Life and Habit</i>; and in 
September, 1908, in his inaugural address to the British 
Association at Dublin, he did Butler the posthumous honour of 
quoting from his translation of Hering&rsquo;s lecture &ldquo;On 
Memory,&rdquo; which is in <i>Unconscious Memory</i>, and of 
mentioning Butler as having enunciated the theory contained in 
<i>Life and Habit</i>.</p>
<p>In 1886 Butler published his last book on evolution, <i>Luck 
or Cunning as the Main Means of Organic Modification</i>?&nbsp; 
His other contributions to the subject are some essays, written 
for the <i>Examiner</i> in 1879, &ldquo;God the Known and God the
Unknown,&rdquo; which were republished by Mr. Fifield in 1909, 
and the articles &ldquo;The Deadlock in Darwinism&rdquo; which 
appeared in the <i>Universal Review</i> in 1890 and some further 
notes on evolution will be found in <i>The Note-Books of Samuel 
Butler</i> (1912).</p>
<p>It was while he was writing <i>Life and Habit</i> that I first
met him.&nbsp; For several years he had been in the habit of 
spending six or eight weeks of the summer in Italy and the Canton
Ticino, generally making Faido his headquarters.&nbsp; Many a 
page of his books was written while resting by the fountain of 
some subalpine village or waiting in the shade of the chestnuts 
till the light came so that he could continue a sketch.&nbsp; 
Every year he returned home by a different route, and thus 
gradually became acquainted with every part of the Canton and 
North Italy.&nbsp; There is scarcely a town or village, a point 
of view, a building, statue or picture in all this country with 
which he was not familiar.&nbsp; In 1878 he happened to be on the
Sacro Monte above Varese at the time I took my holiday; there I 
joined him, and nearly every year afterwards we were in Italy 
together.</p>
<p>He was always a delightful companion, and perhaps at his 
gayest on these occasions.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s 
holiday,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;is his garden,&rdquo; and he
set out to enjoy himself and to make everyone about him enjoy 
themselves too.&nbsp; I told him the old schoolboy muddle about 
Sir Walter Raleigh introducing tobacco and saying: &ldquo;We 
shall this day light up such a fire in England as I trust shall 
never be put out.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had not heard it before and, 
though amused, appeared preoccupied, and perhaps a little 
jealous, during the rest of the evening.&nbsp; Next morning, 
while he was pouring out his coffee, his eyes twinkled and he 
said, with assumed carelessness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the by, do you remember?&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it 
Columbus who bashed the egg down on the table and said 
&lsquo;Eppur non si muove&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was welcome wherever he went, full of fun and ready to play
while doing the honours of the country.&nbsp; Many of the 
peasants were old friends, and every day we were sure to meet 
someone who remembered him.&nbsp; Perhaps it would be an old 
woman labouring along under a burden; she would smile and stop, 
take his hand and tell him how happy she was to meet him again 
and repeat her thanks for the empty wine bottle he had given her 
after an out-of-door luncheon in her neighbourhood four or five 
years before.&nbsp; There was another who had rowed him many 
times across the Lago di Orta and had never been in a train but 
once in her life, when she went to Novara to her son&rsquo;s 
wedding.&nbsp; He always remembered all about these people and 
asked how the potatoes were doing this year and whether the 
grandchildren were growing up into fine boys and girls, and he 
never forgot to inquire after the son who had gone to be a waiter
in New York.&nbsp; At Civiasco there is a restaurant which used 
to be kept by a jolly old lady, known for miles round as La 
Martina; we always lunched with her on our way over the Colma to 
and from Varallo-Sesia.&nbsp; On one occasion we were accompanied
by two English ladies and, one being a teetotaller, Butler 
maliciously instructed La Martina to make the <i>sabbaglione</i> 
so that it should be <i>forte</i> and <i>abbondante</i>, and to 
say that the Marsala, with which it was more than flavoured, was 
nothing but vinegar.&nbsp; La Martina never forgot that when she 
looked in to see how things were going, he was pretending to lick
the dish clean.&nbsp; These journeys provided the material for a 
book which he thought of calling &ldquo;Verdi Prati,&rdquo; after
one of Handel&rsquo;s most beautiful songs; but he changed his 
mind, and it appeared at the end of 1881 as <i>Alps and 
Sanctuaries of Piedmont and the Canton Ticino</i> with more than 
eighty illustrations, nearly all by Butler.&nbsp; Charles Gogin 
made an etching for the frontispiece, drew some of the pictures, 
and put figures into others; half a dozen are mine.&nbsp; They 
were all redrawn in ink from sketches made on the spot, in oil, 
water-colour, and pencil.&nbsp; There were also many 
illustrations of another kind&mdash;extracts from Handel&rsquo;s 
music, each chosen because Butler thought it suitable to the 
spirit of the scene he wished to bring before the reader.&nbsp; 
The introduction concludes with these words: &ldquo;I have chosen
Italy as my second country, and would dedicate this book to her 
as a thank-offering for the happiness she has afforded 
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the spring of 1883 he began to compose music, and in 1885 
we published together an album of minuets, gavottes, and 
fugues.&nbsp; This led to our writing <i>Narcissus</i>, which is 
an Oratorio Buffo in the Handelian manner&mdash;that is as nearly
so as we could make it.&nbsp; It is a mistake to suppose that all
Handel&rsquo;s oratorios are upon sacred subjects; some of them 
are secular.&nbsp; And not only so, but, whatever the subject, 
Handel was never at a loss in treating anything that came into 
his words by way of allusion or illustration.&nbsp; As Butler 
puts it in one of his sonnets:</p>
<blockquote><p>He who gave eyes to ears and showed in sound<br />
All thoughts and things in earth or heaven above&mdash;<br />
From fire and hailstones running along the ground<br />
To Galatea grieving for her love&mdash;<br />
He who could show to all unseeing eyes<br />
Glad shepherds watching o&rsquo;er their flocks by night,<br />
Or Iphis angel-wafted to the skies,<br />
Or Jordan standing as an heap upright&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so on.&nbsp; But there is one subject which Handel never 
treated&mdash;I mean the Money Market.&nbsp; Perhaps he avoided 
it intentionally; he was twice bankrupt, and Mr. R. A. 
Streatfeild tells me that the British Museum possesses a MS. 
letter from him giving instructions as to the payment of the 
dividends on &pound;500 South Sea Stock.&nbsp; Let us hope he 
sold out before the bubble burst; if so, he was more fortunate 
than Butler, who was at this time of his life in great anxiety 
about his own financial affairs.&nbsp; It seemed a pity that Dr. 
Morell had never offered Handel some such words as these:</p>
<blockquote><p>The steadfast funds maintain their wonted state<br
/>
While all the other markets fluctuate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Butler wondered whether Handel would have sent the steadfast 
funds up above par and maintained them on an inverted pedal with 
all the other markets fluctuating iniquitously round them like 
the sheep that turn every one to his own way in the 
<i>Messiah</i>.&nbsp; He thought something of the kind ought to 
have been done, and in the absence of Handel and Dr. Morell we 
determined to write an oratorio that should attempt to supply the
want.&nbsp; In order to make our libretto as plausible as 
possible, we adopted the dictum of Monsieur Jourdain&rsquo;s 
Ma&icirc;tre &agrave; danser: &ldquo;Lorsqu&rsquo;on a des 
personnes &agrave; faire parler en musique, il faut bien que, 
pour la vraisemblance, on donne dans la bergerie.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Narcissus is accordingly a shepherd in love with Amaryllis; they 
come to London with other shepherds and lose their money in 
imprudent speculations on the Stock Exchange.&nbsp; In the second
part the aunt and godmother of Narcissus, having died at an 
advanced age worth one hundred thousand pounds, all of which she 
has bequeathed to her nephew and godson, the obstacle to his 
union with Amaryllis is removed.&nbsp; The money is invested in 
consols and all ends happily.</p>
<p>In December, 1886, Butler&rsquo;s father died, and his 
financial difficulties ceased.&nbsp; He engaged Alfred Emery 
Cathie as clerk, but made no other change, except that he bought 
a pair of new hair brushes and a larger wash-hand basin.&nbsp; 
Any change in his mode of life was an event.&nbsp; When in London
he got up at 6.30 in the summer and 7.30 in the winter, went into
his sitting-room, lighted the fire, put the kettle on and 
returned to bed.&nbsp; In half an hour he got up again, fetched 
the kettle of hot water, emptied it into the cold water that was 
already in his bath, refilled the kettle and put it back on the 
fire.&nbsp; After dressing, he came into his sitting-room, made 
tea and cooked, in his Dutch oven, something he had bought the 
day before.&nbsp; His laundress was an elderly woman, and he 
could not trouble her to come to his rooms so early in the 
morning; on the other hand, he could not stay in bed until he 
thought it right for her to go out; so it ended in his doing a 
great deal for himself.&nbsp; He then got his breakfast and read 
the Times.&nbsp; At 9.30 Alfred came, with whom he discussed 
anything requiring attention, and soon afterwards his laundress 
arrived.&nbsp; Then he started to walk to the British Museum, 
where he arrived about 10.30, every alternate morning calling at 
the butcher&rsquo;s in Fetter Lane to order his meat.&nbsp; In 
the Reading Room at the Museum he sat at Block B (&ldquo;B for 
Butler&rdquo;) and spent an hour &ldquo;posting his 
notes&rdquo;&mdash;that is reconsidering, rewriting, amplifying, 
shortening, and indexing the contents of the little note-book he 
always carried in his pocket.&nbsp; After the notes he went on 
till 1.30 with whatever book he happened to be writing.</p>
<p>On three days of the week he dined in a restaurant on his way 
home, and on the other days he dined in his chambers where his 
laundress had cooked his dinner.&nbsp; At two o&rsquo;clock 
Alfred returned (having been home to dinner with his wife and 
children) and got tea ready for him.&nbsp; He then wrote letters 
and attended to his accounts till 3.45, when he smoked his first 
cigarette.&nbsp; He used to smoke a great deal, but, believing it
to be bad for him, took to cigarettes instead of pipes, and 
gradually smoked less and less, making it a rule not to begin 
till some particular hour, and pushing this hour later and later 
in the day, till it settled itself at 3.45.&nbsp; There was no 
water laid on in his rooms, and every day he fetched one can full
from the tap in the court, Alfred fetching the rest.&nbsp; When 
anyone expostulated with him about cooking his own breakfast and 
fetching his own water, he replied that it was good for him to 
have a change of occupation.&nbsp; This was partly the fact, but 
the real reason, which he could not tell everyone, was that he 
shrank from inconveniencing anybody; he always paid more than was
necessary when anything was done for him, and was not happy then 
unless he did some of the work himself.</p>
<p>At 5.30 he got his evening meal, he called it his tea, and it 
was little more than a facsimile of breakfast.&nbsp; Alfred left 
in time to post the letters before six.&nbsp; Butler then wrote 
music till about 8, when he came to see me in Staple Inn, 
returning to Clifford&rsquo;s Inn by about 10.&nbsp; After a 
light supper, latterly not more than a piece of toast and a glass
of milk, he played one game of his own particular kind of 
Patience, prepared his breakfast things and fire ready for the 
next morning, smoked his seventh and last cigarette, and went to 
bed at eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>He was fond of the theatre, but avoided serious pieces.&nbsp; 
He preferred to take his Shakespeare from the book, finding that 
the spirit of the plays rather evaporated under modern theatrical
treatment.&nbsp; In one of his books he brightens up the old 
illustration of <i>Hamlet</i> without the Prince of Denmark by 
putting it thus: &ldquo;If the character of Hamlet be entirely 
omitted, the play must suffer, even though Henry Irving himself 
be cast for the title-r&ocirc;le.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anyone going to 
the theatre in this spirit would be likely to be less 
disappointed by performances that were comic or even frankly 
farcical.&nbsp; Latterly, when he grew slightly deaf, listening 
to any kind of piece became too much of an effort; nevertheless, 
he continued to the last the habit of going to one pantomime 
every winter.</p>
<p>There were about twenty houses where he visited, but he seldom
accepted an invitation to dinner&mdash;it upset the regularity of
his life; besides, he belonged to no club and had no means of 
returning hospitality.&nbsp; When two colonial friends called 
unexpectedly about noon one day, soon after he settled in London,
he went to the nearest cook-shop in Fetter Lane and returned 
carrying a dish of hot roast pork and greens.&nbsp; This was all 
very well once in a way, but not the sort of thing to be repeated
indefinitely.</p>
<p>On Thursdays, instead of going to the Museum, he often took a 
day off, going into the country sketching or walking, and on 
Sundays, whatever the weather, he nearly always went into the 
country walking; his map of the district for thirty miles round 
London is covered all over with red lines showing where he had 
been.&nbsp; He sometimes went out of town from Saturday to 
Monday, and for over twenty years spent Christmas at 
Boulogne-sur-Mer.</p>
<p>There is a Sacro Monte at Varallo-Sesia with many chapels, 
each containing life-sized statues and frescoes illustrating the 
life of Christ.&nbsp; Butler had visited this sanctuary 
repeatedly, and was a great favourite with the townspeople, who 
knew that he was studying the statues and frescoes in the 
chapels, and who remembered that in the preface to <i>Alps and 
Sanctuaries</i> he had declared his intention of writing about 
them.&nbsp; In August, 1887, the Varallesi brought matters to a 
head by giving him a civic dinner on the Mountain.&nbsp; Everyone
was present, there were several speeches and, when we were coming
down the slippery mountain path after it was all over, he said to
me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, there&rsquo;s nothing for it now but to write
that book about the Sacro Monte at once.&nbsp; It must be the 
next thing I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, on returning home, he took up photography and, 
immediately after Christmas, went back to Varallo to photograph 
the statues and collect material.&nbsp; Much research was 
necessary and many visits to out-of-the-way sanctuaries which 
might have contained work by the sculptor Tabachetti, whom he was
rescuing from oblivion and identifying with the Flemish Jean de 
Wespin.&nbsp; One of these visits, made after his book was 
published, forms the subject of &ldquo;The Sanctuary of 
Montrigone.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Ex Voto</i>, the book about Varallo, 
appeared in 1888, and an Italian translation by Cavaliere Angelo 
Rizzetti was published at Novara in 1894.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quis Desiderio . . . ?&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>The Humour of 
Homer and Other Essays</i>) was developed in 1888 from something 
in a letter from Miss Savage nearly ten years earlier.&nbsp; On 
the 15th of December, 1878, in acknowledging this letter, Butler 
wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am sure that any tree or flower nursed by Miss 
Cobbe would be the <i>very</i> first to fade away and that her 
gazelles would die long before they ever came to know her 
<i>well</i>.&nbsp; The sight of the brass buttons on her 
pea-jacket would settle them out of hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was an enclosure in Miss Savage&rsquo;s letter, but it 
is unfortunately lost; I suppose it must have been a newspaper 
cutting with an allusion to Moore&rsquo;s poem and perhaps a 
portrait of Miss Frances Power Cobbe&mdash;pea-jacket, brass 
buttons, and all.</p>
<p>On the 10th November, 1879, Miss Savage, having been ill, 
wrote to Butler:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been dipping into the books of Moses, being
sometimes at a loss for something to read while shut up in my 
apartment.&nbsp; You know that I have never read the Bible much, 
consequently there is generally something of a novelty that I hit
on.&nbsp; As you do know your Bible well, perhaps you can tell me
what became of Aaron.&nbsp; The account given of his end in 
Numbers xx. is extremely ambiguous and unsatisfactory.&nbsp; 
Evidently he did not come by his death fairly, but whether he was
murdered secretly for the furtherance of some private ends, or 
publicly in a State sacrifice, I can&rsquo;t make out.&nbsp; I 
myself rather incline to the former opinion, but I should like to
know what the experts say about it.&nbsp; A very nice, exciting 
little tale might be made out of it in the style of the police 
stories in <i>All the rear Round</i> called &ldquo;The Mystery of
Mount Hor or What became of Aaron?&rdquo;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t 
forget to write to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Butler&rsquo;s people had been suggesting that he should try 
to earn money by writing in magazines, and Miss Savage was 
falling in with the idea and offering a practical 
suggestion.&nbsp; I do not find that he had anything to tell her 
about the death of Aaron.&nbsp; On 23rd March, 1880, she 
wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Mr. Butler: Read the subjoined poem of 
Wordsworth and let me know what you understand its meaning to 
be.&nbsp; Of course I have my opinion, which I think of 
communicating to the Wordsworth Society.&nbsp; You can belong to 
that Society for the small sum of 2/6 per annum.&nbsp; I think of
joining because it is cheap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The subjoined poem&rdquo; was the one beginning: 
&ldquo;She dwelt among the untrodden ways,&rdquo; and Butler made
this note on the letter:</p>
<p>To the foregoing letter I answered that I concluded Miss 
Savage meant to imply that Wordsworth had murdered Lucy in order 
to escape a prosecution for breach of promise.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Miss Savage to Butler</i>.</p>
<p>2nd April, 1880: My dear Mr. Butler: I don&rsquo;t think you 
see all that I do in the poem, and I am afraid that the 
suggestion of a <span class="smcap">dark secret</span> in the 
poet&rsquo;s life is not so very obvious after all.&nbsp; I was 
hoping you would propose to devote yourself for a few months to 
reading the <i>Excursion</i>, his letters, &amp;c., with a view 
to following up the clue, and I am disappointed though, to say 
the truth, the idea of a <i>crime</i> had not flashed upon me 
when I wrote to you.&nbsp; How well the works of <i>great</i> men
repay attention and study!&nbsp; But you, who know your Bible so 
well, how was it that you did not detect the plagiarism in the 
last verse?&nbsp; Just refer to the account of the disappearance 
of Aaron (I have not a Bible at hand, we want one sadly in the 
club) but I am sure that the words are identical [I cannot see 
what Miss Savage meant.&nbsp; 1901. S. B.]&nbsp; 
<i>Cassell&rsquo;s Magazine</i> have offered a prize for setting 
the poem to music, and I fell to thinking how it could be treated
musically, and so came to a right comprehension of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Butler, when editing Miss Savage&rsquo;s letters in 
1901, could not see the resemblance between Wordsworth&rsquo;s 
poem and Numbers xx., he at once saw a strong likeness between 
Lucy and Moore&rsquo;s heroine whom he had been keeping in an 
accessible pigeon-hole of his memory ever since his letter about 
Miss Frances Power Cobbe.&nbsp; He now sent Lucy to keep her 
company and often spoke of the pair of them as probably the two 
most disagreeable young women in English literature&mdash;an 
opinion which he must have expressed to Miss Savage and with 
which I have no doubt she agreed.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1888, on his return from photographing the 
statues at Varallo, he found, to his disgust, that the 
authorities of the British Museum had removed Frost&rsquo;s 
<i>Lives of Eminent Christians</i> from its accustomed shelf in 
the Reading Room.&nbsp; Soon afterwards Harry Quilter asked him 
to write for the <i>Universal Review</i> and he responded with 
&ldquo;Quis Desiderio . . . ?&rdquo;&nbsp; In this essay he 
compares himself to Wordsworth and dwells on the points of 
resemblance between Lucy and the book of whose assistance he had 
now been deprived in a passage which echoes the opening of 
Chapter V of <i>Ex Voto</i>, where he points out the resemblances
between Varallo and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Early in 1888 the leading members of the Shrewsbury 
Arch&aelig;ological Society asked Butler to write a memoir of his
grandfather and of his father for their Quarterly Journal.&nbsp; 
This he undertook to do when he should have finished <i>Ex 
Voto</i>.&nbsp; In December, 1888, his sisters, with the idea of 
helping him to write the memoir, gave him his grandfather&rsquo;s
correspondence, which extended from 1790 to 1839.&nbsp; On 
looking over these very voluminous papers he became penetrated 
with an almost Chinese reverence for his ancestor and, after 
getting the Arch&aelig;ological Society to absolve him from his 
promise to write the memoir, set about a full life of Dr. Butler,
which was not published till 1896.&nbsp; The delay was caused 
partly by the immense quantity of documents he had to sift and 
digest, the number of people he had to consult, and the many 
letters he had to write, and partly by something that arose out 
of <i>Narcissus</i>, which we published in June, 1888.</p>
<p>Butler was not satisfied with having written only half of this
work; he wanted it to have a successor, so that by adding his two
halves together, he could say he had written a whole Handelian 
oratorio.&nbsp; While staying with his sisters at Shrewsbury with
this idea in his mind, he casually took up a book by Alfred 
Ainger about Charles Lamb and therein stumbled upon something 
about the <i>Odyssey</i>.&nbsp; It was years since he had looked 
at the poem, but, from what he remembered, he thought it might 
provide a suitable subject for musical treatment.&nbsp; He did 
not, however, want to put Dr. Butler aside, so I undertook to 
investigate.&nbsp; It is stated on the title-page of both 
<i>Narcissus</i> and <i>Ulysses</i> that the words were written 
and the music composed by both of us.&nbsp; As to the music, each
piece bears the initials of the one who actually composed 
it.&nbsp; As to the words, it was necessary first to settle some 
general scheme and this, in the case of <i>Narcissus</i>, grew in
the course of conversation.&nbsp; The scheme of <i>Ulysses</i> 
was constructed in a more formal way and Butler had perhaps 
rather less to do with it.&nbsp; We were bound by the 
<i>Odyssey</i>, which is, of course, too long to be treated 
fully, and I selected incidents that attracted me and settled the
order of the songs and choruses.&nbsp; For this purpose, as I 
out-Shakespeare Shakespeare in the smallness of my Greek, I used 
<i>The Adventures of Ulysses</i> by Charles Lamb, which we should
have known nothing about but for Ainger&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; 
Butler acquiesced in my proposals, but, when it came to the words
themselves, he wrote practically all the libretto, as he had done
in the case of <i>Narcissus</i>; I did no more than suggest a few
phrases and a few lines here and there.</p>
<p>We had sent <i>Narcissus</i> for review to the papers, and, as
a consequence, about this time, made the acquaintance of Mr. J. 
A. Fuller Maitland, then musical critic of the <i>Times</i>; he 
introduced us to that learned musician William Smith Rockstro, 
under whom we studied medieval counterpoint while composing 
<i>Ulysses</i>.&nbsp; We had already made some progress with it 
when it occurred to Butler that it would not take long and might,
perhaps, be safer if he were to look at the original poem, just 
to make sure that Lamb had not misled me.&nbsp; Not having 
forgotten all his Greek, he bought a copy of the <i>Odyssey</i> 
and was so fascinated by it that he could not put it down.&nbsp; 
When he came to the Phoeacian episode of Ulysses at Scheria he 
felt he must be reading the description of a real place and that 
something in the personality of the author was eluding him.&nbsp;
For months he was puzzled, and, to help in clearing up the 
mystery, set about translating the poem.&nbsp; In August, 1891, 
he had preceded me to Chiavenna, and on a letter I wrote him, 
telling him when to expect me, he made this note:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was during the few days that I was at Chiavenna
(at the Hotel Grotta Crim&eacute;e) that I hit upon the feminine 
authorship of the <i>Odyssey</i>.&nbsp; I did not find out its 
having been written at Trapani till January, 1892.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He suspected that the authoress in describing both Scheria and
Ithaca was drawing from her native country and searched on the 
Admiralty charts for the features enumerated in the poem; this 
led him to the conclusion that the country could only be Trapani,
Mount Eryx, and the &AElig;gadean Islands.&nbsp; As soon as he 
could after this discovery he went to Sicily to study the 
locality and found it in all respects suitable for his theory; 
indeed, it was astonishing how things kept turning up to support 
his view.&nbsp; It is all in his book <i>The Authoress of the 
Odyssey</i>, published in 1897 and dedicated to his friend 
Cavaliere Biagio Ingroja of Calatafimi.</p>
<p>His first visit to Sicily was in 1892, in August&mdash;a hot 
time of the year, but it was his custom to go abroad in the 
autumn.&nbsp; He returned to Sicily every year (except one), but 
latterly went in the spring.&nbsp; He made many friends all over 
the island, and after his death the people of Calatafimi called a
street by his name, the Via Samuel Butler, &ldquo;thus,&rdquo; as
Ingroja wrote when he announced the event to me, &ldquo;honouring
a great man&rsquo;s memory, handing down his name to posterity, 
and doing homage to the friendly English nation.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Besides showing that the <i>Odyssey</i> was written by a woman in
Sicily and translating the poem into English prose, he also 
translated the <i>Iliad</i>, and, in March, 1895, went to Greece 
and the Troad to see the country therein described, where he 
found nothing to cause him to disagree with the received 
theories.</p>
<p>It has been said of him in a general way that the fact of an 
opinion being commonly held was enough to make him profess the 
opposite.&nbsp; It was enough to make him examine the opinion for
himself, when it affected any of the many subjects which 
interested him, and if, after giving it his best attention, he 
found it did not hold water, then no weight of authority could 
make him say that it did.&nbsp; This matter of the geography of 
the <i>Iliad</i> is only one among many commonly received 
opinions which he examined for himself and found no reason to 
dispute; on these he considered it unnecessary to write.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of his passion for doing things 
thoroughly that he learnt nearly the whole of the <i>Odyssey</i> 
and the <i>Iliad</i> by heart.&nbsp; He had a Pickering copy of 
each poem, which he carried in his pocket and referred to in 
railway trains, both in England and Italy, when saying the poems 
over to himself.&nbsp; These two little books are now in the 
library of St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.&nbsp; He was, 
however, disappointed to find that he could not retain more than 
a book or two at a time and that, on learning more, he forgot 
what he had learnt first; but he was about sixty at the 
time.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets, on which he published a 
book in 1899, gave him less trouble in this respect; he knew them
all by heart, and also their order, and one consequence of this 
was that he wrote some sonnets in the Shakespearian form.&nbsp; 
He found this intimate knowledge of the poet&rsquo;s work more 
useful for his purpose than reading commentaries by those who are
less familiar with it.&nbsp; &ldquo;A commentary on a 
poem,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;may be useful as material on 
which to form an estimate of the commentator, but the poem itself
is the most important document you can consult, and it is 
impossible to know it too intimately if you want to form an 
opinion about it and its author.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was always the author, the work of God, that interested him
more than the book&mdash;the work of man; the painter more than 
the picture; the composer more than the music.&nbsp; &ldquo;If a 
writer, a painter, or a musician makes me feel that he held those
things to be lovable which I myself hold to be lovable I am 
satisfied; art is only interesting in so far as it reveals the 
personality of the artist.&rdquo;&nbsp; Handel was, of course, 
&ldquo;the greatest of all musicians.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among the 
painters he chiefly loved Giovanni Bellini, Carpaccio, Gaudenzio 
Ferrari, Rembrandt, Holbein, Velasquez, and De Hooghe; in poetry 
Shakespeare, Homer, and the Authoress of the <i>Odyssey</i>; and 
in architecture the man, whoever he was, who designed the Temple 
of Neptune at Paestum.&nbsp; Life being short, he did not see why
he should waste any of it in the company of inferior people when 
he had these.&nbsp; And he treated those he met in daily life in 
the same spirit: it was what he found them to be that attracted 
or repelled him; what others thought about them was of little or 
no consequence.</p>
<p>And now, at the end of his life, his thoughts reverted to the 
two subjects which had occupied him more than thirty years 
previously&mdash;namely, <i>Erewhon</i> and the evidence for the 
death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The idea of what 
might follow from belief in one single supposed miracle had been 
slumbering during all those years and at last rose again in the 
form of a sequel to <i>Erewhon</i>.&nbsp; In <i>Erewhon 
Revisited</i> Mr. Higgs returns to find that the Erewhonians now 
believe in him as a god in consequence of the supposed miracle of
his going up in a balloon to induce his heavenly father to send 
the rain.&nbsp; Mr. Higgs and the reader know that there was no 
miracle in the case, but Butler wanted to show that whether it 
was a miracle or not did not signify provided that the people 
believed it be one.&nbsp; And so Mr. Higgs is present in the 
temple which is being dedicated to him and his worship.</p>
<p>The existence of his son George was an afterthought and gave 
occasion for the second leading idea of the book&mdash;the story 
of a father trying to win the love of a hitherto unknown son by 
risking his life in order to show himself worthy of it&mdash;and 
succeeding.</p>
<p>Butler&rsquo;s health had already begun to fail, and when he 
started for Sicily on Good Friday, 1902, it was for the last 
time: he knew he was unfit to travel, but was determined to go, 
and was looking forward to meeting Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Fuller 
Maitland, whom he was to accompany over the Odyssean scenes at 
Trapani and Mount Eryx.&nbsp; But he did not get beyond Palermo; 
there he was so much worse that he could not leave his 
room.&nbsp; In a few weeks he was well enough to be removed to 
Naples, and Alfred went out and brought him home to London.&nbsp;
He was taken to a nursing home in St. John&rsquo;s Wood where he 
lay for a month, attended by his old friend Dr. Dudgeon, and 
where he died on the 18th June, 1902.</p>
<p>There was a great deal he still wanted to do.&nbsp; He had 
intended to revise <i>The Way of All Flesh</i>, to write a book 
about Tabachetti, and to publish a new edition of <i>Ex Voto</i> 
with the mistakes corrected.&nbsp; Also he wished to reconsider 
the articles reprinted in <i>The Humour of Homer</i>, and was 
looking forward to painting more sketches and composing more 
music.&nbsp; While lying ill and very feeble within a few days of
the end, and not knowing whether it was to be the end or not, he 
said to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am much better to-day.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t feel at 
all as though I were going to die.&nbsp; Of course, it will be 
all wrong if I do get well, for there is my literary position to 
be considered.&nbsp; First I write <i>Erewhon</i>&mdash;that is 
my opening subject; then, after modulating freely through all my 
other books and the music and so on, I return gracefully to my 
original key and write <i>Erewhon Revisited</i>.&nbsp; Obviously,
now is the proper moment to come to a full close, make my bow and
retire; but I believe I am getting well, after all.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s very inartistic, but I cannot help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of his readers complain that they often do not know 
whether he is serious or jesting.&nbsp; He wrote of Lord 
Beaconsfield: &ldquo;Earnestness was his greatest danger, but if 
he did not quite overcome it (as indeed who can? it is the last 
enemy that shall be subdued), he managed to veil it with a fair 
amount of success.&rdquo;&nbsp; To veil his own earnestness he 
turned most naturally to humour, employing it in a spirit of 
reverence, as all the great humorists have done, to express his 
deepest and most serious convictions.&nbsp; He was aware that he 
ran the risk of being misunderstood by some, but he also knew 
that it is useless to try to please all, and, like Mozart, he 
wrote to please himself and a few intimate friends.</p>
<p>I cannot speak at length of his kindness, consideration, and 
sympathy; nor of his generosity, the extent of which was very 
great and can never be known&mdash;it was sometimes exercised in 
unexpected ways, as when he gave my laundress a shilling because 
it was &ldquo;such a beastly foggy morning&rdquo;; nor of his 
slightly archaic courtliness&mdash;unless among people he knew 
well he usually left the room backwards, bowing to the company; 
nor of his punctiliousness, industry, and painstaking attention 
to detail&mdash;he kept accurate accounts not only of all his 
property by double entry but also of his daily expenditure, which
he balanced to a halfpenny every evening, and his handwriting, 
always beautiful and legible, was more so at sixty-six than at 
twenty-six; nor of his patience and cheerfulness during years of 
anxiety when he had few to sympathize with him; nor of the 
strange mixture of simplicity and shrewdness that caused one who 
knew him well to say: &ldquo;Il sait tout; il ne sait rien; il 
est po&egrave;te.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Epitaphs always fascinated him, and formerly he used to say he
should like to be buried at Langar and to have on his tombstone 
the subject of the last of Handel&rsquo;s <i>Six Great 
Fugues</i>.&nbsp; He called this &ldquo;The Old Man Fugue,&rdquo;
and said it was like an epitaph composed for himself by one who 
was very old and tired and sorry for things; and he made young 
Ernest Pontifex in <i>The Way of All Flesh</i> offer it to Edward
Overton as an epitaph for his Aunt Alethea.&nbsp; Butler, 
however, left off wanting any tombstone long before he 
died.&nbsp; In accordance with his wish his body was cremated, 
and a week later Alfred and I returned to Woking and buried his 
ashes under the shrubs in the garden of the crematorium, with 
nothing to mark the spot.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
